          Volleyball is one of my greatest passions. I love the thrill of the game, the teamwork, and the competitive spirit it brings. Whether it's a friendly match with friends or a competitive league game, I'm always excited to be on the court. I have been playing volleyball for many years and have competed in various tournaments, enhancing my skills and dedication to the sport.

        <p>
          Soccer holds a special place in my heart. I've been playing since I was a kid, and I'm passionate about the sport. From scoring goals to making crucial passes, the soccer field is where I feel most alive. I have had the privilege of playing for both school teams and local clubs, which has allowed me to develop my skills and grow as a player.

          I find solace in the great outdoors. Hiking through scenic trails, camping under the stars, and exploring nature's beauty are some of my favorite activities. It's a way for me to unwind and connect with the world around me. Whether it's a weekend camping trip or a day-long hike, I cherish every moment spent in nature.

          Given this html file, ignore the current CSS elements in the file and recreate the file with css as a professional website contain my hobbies. I want to have three sections with 3 images. One section  about my love for volleyball. One section about my love for soccer. One section about loving the outdoors. You can take the paragraph in the html to go off of for writing the sections. I would like the navigation menus to remain the same but they can be restyled with css.
