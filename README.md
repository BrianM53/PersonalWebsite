Howdy! I'm excited to share the details of my completed website.

View website with this link: https://people.tamu.edu/~brianmckeown/

Implemented Pages and Features:

1. Landing Area
Crafted to leave a positive first impression.
Engages the audience with compelling information tailored for prospective employers or organizations.
Shows off my unique personality and how I'd seamlessly fit into a team and corporate culture.
Kept it clear and concise, including only information that truly belongs here.

2. Technical Portfolio
Describes my technical projects, spicing it up with interesting details like links to my TAMU GitHub repository, project thumbnails, and concise descriptions.

3. Qualifications Section
Provides my resume in an easily accessible format (PDF preferred, but I've got an HTML version too).
Dives deeper into my technical skills, offering more insights than what's on my resume.
Shares my thoughts on the technical areas in Computer Science that excite me and why they do.

4. Service Section
Talks about the ways I give back to my community, whether it's through volunteering, mentoring, or similar activities.
Might hint at areas I'd love to contribute to in the future, if I'm not already involved.

5. AI-Generated Page
Created an additional page using an AI tool (Guess which one it is... it's not too hard :D).
The content topic is diverse, but it reflects my passions and was generated using a simple prompt.

Navigation Requirements
Implemented clear and consistent navigation for all pages.
Made sure every page is linked from some other page.
The "Landing Area" page is the hub, linking to all other pages.

External Links
Sprinkled in a minimum of 10 different links to external web pages relevant to me and the work I'm doing.
Integrated these links naturally throughout my project, steering clear of a single “links” section.

Style Toggle Feature
Successfully implemented a style toggle feature using a button or checkbox.
Changed the appearance of the website by alternating between different CSS files with JavaScript.
Started the new CSS file from scratch, planning the layout before diving into implementation.
