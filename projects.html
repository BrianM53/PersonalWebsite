            In my Computer Architecture course, I learned about the tedious world of computer architecture leading to the final project of creating a Y86-64 Processor. This project took a complete understanding of the Y86-64 ISA, the full fetch, decode, and execute cycle, along with RAM and ROM components. To test it, I wrote multiple Y86-64 ISA programs, including implementations of bubble sort and matrix multiplication. This project taught me a lot about how low levels of computing work and will give me a very solid foundational understanding of how my code runs in the future. Our teachers say it's one thing to know how to drive a car but it is another to learn how the motor works and I believe that is what is at the heart of this project.

            In a competitive and high-stress environment at the Texas A&M Hackathon, I teamed up with three others to develop a Speech to American Sign Language Translator within the tight 24-hour deadline. Making use of natural language processing, we crafted an application capable of translating spoken English into American Sign Language images, demonstrating our proficiency in rapid problem-solving and innovation. This project taught me a lot about how to build a complete program. This was my first exposure to many front-end development techniques and learning how to integrate that with the back-end was a challenge I learned a lot from.

            I spearheaded a project to design and construct a pergola for a low-income neighborhood with our Engineers Without Borders Chapter. This intricate effort included research and design work using CAD software, fundraising efforts through donor outreach and communication, and the hands-on construction of the pergola on-site. The best part of this project however was giving back to the community. It was truly an honor to work with such a great team with such kind-hearted individuals. I learned so much from this project about engineering, real world problem solving, and so much more. It was truly an experience I wouldnâ€™t trade for the world.
